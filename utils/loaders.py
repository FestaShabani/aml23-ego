        We have a video clip represented by record, which starts at record.start_frame and contains multiple frames. 
        The idx represents the index of the frame within this specific video clip.
        To find the index of the frame within the entire untrimmed video (so, not in the specificc clip).
        Suppose: 
        record.start_frame = 100: the video clip starts at frame index 100.
        idx = 20: the 20th frame within this video clip.
        idx_untrimmed = 100 + 20 = 120
        The path of the image: something like ../ek_data/frames/img_0000000005.jpg
        It opens the image and returns the RGB version of it in img

        Explanation for the case when idx_untrimmed > max_idx_video:
            Sometimes, due to various reasons such as missing frames or incomplete data, the frame indices in the dataset may not be contiguous.
            In such cases, the maximum frame index found provides an upper bound for the available frames, allowing the code to handle situations where the dataset does not contain frames for every possible index
            If the requested frame index exceeds the maximum available frame index, the code falls back to loading the image for the maximum available frame index. This ensures that even if the requested frame is not available, the code can still provide an image for the nearest available frame.
