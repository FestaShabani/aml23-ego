# How to Run This Project
This repository contains four interactive Python notebooks designed for different aspects of our experiments:

* EK_feature_extraction.ipynb
 * EK_Classifiers.ipynb
 * EK_features_plot.ipynb
* AML_AN.ipynb


Overview

EK_feature_extraction.ipynb
This notebook contains the code for extracting RGB features from the Epic Kitchen dataset. It supports various configurations based on the number of frames (5, 10, 25), sampling strategies (dense, uniform), and training methods (pretrained, fine-tuned).


EK_Classifiers.ipynb
For a deeper analysis of our results, this notebook contains all the classification results. It details the performance of different classifiers based on various configurations.


EK_features_plot.ipynb
This notebook includes all the plots for the extracted features. It provides visualizations to help analyze the feature extraction results from different configurations.

AML_AN.ipynb
This notebook covers all preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification tasks for the ActionNet dataset. It includes classifiers for EMG data, training of the Variational Autoencoder, and multimodal classifiers.

Notes
We have aimed to make the code as clear as possible, with comments providing a high-level understanding of our objectives. The results are presented in a clear and compact manner, utilizing visualizations and classification outcomes to evaluate our findings.
